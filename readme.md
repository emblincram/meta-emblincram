# meta-emblincram

Yocto meta layer for a distributed application example.

# installation

Run the `install.sh` script for the first-stage project initialization.

**Warning:**

The dev container executes the scripts `initialize-command.sh` and `post-process-command.sh` from the `toolbox` directory.

These scripts are executed after "Reopen in Dev Container" in `VS Code` and ensure that additional components are checked out and installed in the project directory.
